## Very important rules
- **NEVER** create fallbacks or legacy compatibility
- **NEVER** jump to coding, think about a plan and wait for my agreement
- **NEVER** modify the ui, component or layout if not explicitly asked and ask for confirmation
- **ALWAYS** provide guidance if i ask you to do something that does not respect our rules or best practices
- **ALWAYS** delete obsolete or deprecated files, no backward compatibility
