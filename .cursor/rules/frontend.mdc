# Frontend Component Guidelines

## Component Organization
- **Feature Components** in `/app/[locale]/[tenant]/[feature]/_components/`
- **Shared Components** in `/components/ui/`, `/components/layout/`, etc.
- **shadcn Components** in `/components/shadcn/` (NEVER modify)

## Context Usage
- Always import context from centralized location: `import { useHost } from '@/context'`
- NEVER import from feature-specific contexts (deprecated)
- Add 'use client' directive to client components

## Component Structure
1. Define props interface at the top
2. Place helper functions and constants next
3. Implement the component last
4. Use proper Typescript types

## State Management
- Use context for shared state across components
- Use local state for component-specific state
- Use loading/error patterns from the context
- Handle error states and empty states gracefully

## Forms and User Input
- Validate inputs before submission
- Show loading indicators during processing
- Provide clear error messages
- Implement proper ARIA attributes for accessibility

## Styling
- Use Tailwind CSS utility classes
- Follow design system patterns for consistent UI
- Use shadcn components as the foundation
- Ensure responsive design with appropriate breakpoints
