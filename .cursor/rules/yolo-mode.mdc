# YOLO Mode Development Guidelines

## What is YOLO Mode?

YOLO Mode ("You Only Look Once") is an approach to rapid development that prioritizes:
- Quick context acquisition
- Minimal token usage
- Efficient development patterns
- Focus on critical functionality first
- Start with low rish enhancement and fix

### Critical File Paths
- **Prisma Schema**: `prisma/schema.prisma`
- **Environment Config**: `src/lib/env.ts`

## Rapid Development Patterns

## Token Optimization Strategies

1. **Minimize Rule Reading**:
   - Start with only `general.mdc` and this file
   - Read other rules only when needed for specific tasks

2. **Use Targeted Searches**:
   - Search for specific patterns rather than reading entire files
   - Use semantic search with precise queries

3. **Leverage Code Examples**:
   - Reference the examples in this file for common patterns
   - Copy and adapt patterns rather than generating from scratch

4. **Prioritize Server Components**:
   - Use React Server Components by default
   - Only add 'use client' when necessary for interactivity

5. **Efficient File Organization**:
   - Keep related code together
   - Use the health check script to identify files that need refactoring

## Performance Quick Wins

1. **Server-Side Rendering**:
   - Use React Server Components for data fetching
   - Keep client-side JavaScript minimal

2. **Code Splitting**:
   - Use dynamic imports for large components
   - Implement lazy loading for below-the-fold content

3. **Image Optimization**:
   - Use Next.js Image component with proper sizing
   - Implement lazy loading for images

4. **Bundle Size Reduction**:
   - Avoid large dependencies
   - Use tree-shakable libraries

5. **Caching Strategies**:
   - Implement proper caching for API responses
   - Use incremental static regeneration where appropriate
