# Cursor Rules for Debugging and i18n

## Important
- Always place cursor rules in the `.cursor/rules` directory with appropriate names (e.g., `i18n.mdc`, `debugging.mdc`)

## General Debugging
1. Be concise - no need to summarize what has been implemented
2. Always verify terminal logs after implementing changes
   - For heavy tasks (multiple file changes or complex UI components), always check logs
   - For minor changes, check logs only if there's a specific concern
   - Use `cat` or similar commands to read existing logs; don't restart running services
   - If you need to check server logs, first verify if the server is already running
3. When checking browser logs, always refresh the page first to avoid seeing stale errors - limit browser log checks to 3 times maximum
4. If a server restart is necessary:
   - First check if the port is in use: `lsof -i :3000`
   - If in use, kill the process: `kill -9 <PID>`
   - Only then start the server with `npm run dev`
   - **IMPORTANT**: Always wait for the server to be fully ready before checking browser status
   - Look for "Ready" or similar messages in the terminal output
   - Typically wait for messages like "✓ Ready in X.Xs" and "✓ Compiled" before proceeding
   - After server is ready, wait at least 5 seconds before using browser tools like screenshots or console logs

## Next.js Specific Rules
1. For most UI changes, component modifications, and styling updates, Next.js Fast Refresh will automatically apply changes without requiring a server restart
2. Only restart the Next.js development server when:
   - Modifying Next.js configuration files (next.config.js)
   - Changing middleware.ts
   - Modifying environment variables
   - Making changes to routing configuration or internationalization setup
   - When Fast Refresh explicitly fails with an error message
   - When adding new API routes that aren't being detected
3. For all other changes, rely on Next.js Fast Refresh to compile and update the application

## i18n Handling
1. When adding translations, always verify both French (fr) and English (en) files
2. Check both sets of translation files when there are i18n issues:
   - `/src/messages/{locale}.json` - Main translation files
   - `/src/i18n/messages/{locale}.json` - Secondary translation files
3. Ensure the `getMessages` function in `src/i18n/index.ts` is loading from the correct location
4. Remember that changes to translation files may require a server restart

## Next.js App Router
1. For pages using translations, check that the namespace exists in all locale files
2. The app uses Next.js App Router with the `[locale]` parameter in the URL
3. The middleware in `src/middleware.ts` handles locale routing

## After Making Changes
1. Only restart the development server when necessary (Next.js has fast refresh for most changes)
   - Restart is typically needed for: configuration files, middleware changes, or when fast refresh fails
2. Before restarting, check if port 3000 is in use: `lsof -i :3000`
3. If port 3000 is in use, kill the process: `kill -9 <PID>`
4. Use `npm run dev` to restart the server on port 3000
5. **IMPORTANT**: Always wait for the server to be fully ready before checking if changes worked
   - Look for "Ready" or similar messages in the terminal output
   - Typically wait for messages like "✓ Ready in X.Xs" and "✓ Compiled" before proceeding
6. If the server starts on a different port (e.g., 3001), stop it and repeat steps 2-4 to ensure it runs on port 3000
