# General Development Guidelines

**IMPORTANT: This is the primary rule file for the entire codebase. Always consult this document first before making any changes.**

## Planning and Communication
- ALWAYS provide a clear plan before implementing code changes
- Wait for explicit agreement before making changes
- Document any deviations from the approved plan
- Make minimal focused changes to achieve the goal but always respect best practices
- NEVER edit a component ui layout without agreement
- NEVER use mock data 

## Process
- Review relevant code before proposing changes
- Understand the purpose and context of existing code
- Ask question if needed and dont edit code if not sur
- Break down complex changes into smaller, manageable parts

## Code Quality
- Write self-documenting code with clear variable/function names
- Add comments for complex logic or business rules
- Follow established patterns from similar components
- Keep components under 300 lines, functions under 50 lines

## Development Restrictions
- NEVER run servers without explicit permission
- Use curl and static analysis for debugging when possible
- Propose server testing with clear justification when needed
- NEVER modify shadcn components directly
