# Double-Click Enhancement and Code Cleanup

## Overview

This update enhances the node double-click functionality in the Navigation Editor and cleans up obsolete tree-related code.

## Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced Double-Click Behavior (`useNavigationEditor.ts`)

**Previous behavior:**
- Only worked for menu nodes with associated trees
- Attempted to navigate to tree_id/tree_name (obsolete functionality)
- Logged errors when menu nodes didn't have associated trees

**New behavior:**
- **When filter is active (focusNodeId is set):** Double-clicking any node resets the filter to show all nodes
- **When no filter is active:** Double-clicking a focusable node (menu or root type) focuses on that node with depth limit 3
- **Non-focusable nodes:** Double-click is ignored with appropriate logging

### 2. Enhanced TreeFilterControls Component

**Visual improvements:**
- Added tooltips for better user guidance
- Visual indicators when filter is active (highlighted border, different button style)
- "Filtered" chip when filter is applied
- Dynamic status text and hints about double-click functionality
- Bold styling for statistics when filter is active

**User experience improvements:**
- Clear visual feedback about current filter state
- Contextual hints about double-click behavior
- Warning-colored reset button when filter is active

## Code Cleanup

### Removed Obsolete Tree Navigation Code

The following obsolete functionality was removed:
- Tree ID and tree name navigation logic
- URL navigation to tree-specific paths
- Database loading calls for tree navigation
- Path and name path management for tree hierarchies

**Reason for removal:** The codebase has evolved beyond the tree-based navigation model, and this code was causing errors and confusion.

## Usage Instructions

### For Users

1. **To focus on a specific node:**
   - Double-click the node when no filter is active
   - Or use the Node dropdown in the header

2. **To reset filter and show all nodes:**
   - Double-click any node when a filter is active
   - Or click the Reset button in the header
   - Or select "All" from the Node dropdown

3. **Visual cues:**
   - When filter is active: Node dropdown has blue border, Reset button is orange, "Filtered" chip appears
   - Status text shows current/total nodes and includes contextual hints

### For Developers

#### Event Flow
```
Node Double-Click → Check if filter active
├─ If filter active → Reset filter (setFocusNodeId(null), setMaxDisplayDepth(5))
└─ If no filter → Focus on node (if focusable) with depth 3
```

#### Focusable Node Types
- `type === 'menu'`
- `data.is_root === true`

#### Logging
All double-click actions are logged with the format:
```
[@hook:useNavigationEditor] Double-click on node: {label} (type: {type})
[@hook:useNavigationEditor] Filter is active/No filter active, {action}
```

## Benefits

1. **Improved UX:** Clear visual feedback and intuitive navigation
2. **Reduced Confusion:** Removed error-prone obsolete tree navigation
3. **Better Discoverability:** Tooltips and hints guide users
4. **Consistent Behavior:** Double-click works for all node types with appropriate logic
5. **Cleaner Codebase:** Removed obsolete navigation code that was causing errors

## Testing

To test the functionality:

1. Load the Navigation Editor
2. Try double-clicking nodes with no filter active → should focus on focusable nodes
3. Apply a filter (select a node from dropdown) → UI should show filter indicators
4. Double-click any node while filter is active → should reset filter
5. Verify tooltips and visual indicators work as expected

## Technical Notes

- The `onNodeDoubleClickUpdated` function now has a cleaner dependency array: `[navigationState]`
- Removed dependencies on `navigate`, `crudHook.loadFromDatabase` which were part of obsolete functionality
- TreeFilterControls component is now more self-contained with better visual feedback
- All changes maintain backward compatibility with existing node selection and filtering logic
