**VirtualPyTest** is a Python-based test automation framework for devices (e.g., Android, STB, Apple), using a model-data approach to reduce script duplication. It models the system under test as a JSON navigation tree, supports functional, performance, endurance, and robustness tests, and uses MongoDB for test cases, trees, results, and logs. Key features include:

- **Device-Agnostic Test Cases**: JSON-based, with verifications (`appear`/`disappear` for image/audio/video/text, `AND`/`OR`).
- **Orchestrator**: Manages campaigns, selecting trees, controllers (Bluetooth, ADB, HDMI), and tests via JSON/CLI.
- **Controllers**: Placeholder `Remote`, `AudioVideo`, and `Verification` controllers, extensible for real implementations.
- **Auto-Test Generation**: Creates tests (`validateAll`, `validateSpecificNodes`, `validateCommonPaths`).
- **Prioritization**: Optional, data-driven via MongoDB failure rates/client metrics.
- **Reporting/Logging**: JSON reports in `outputs/reports/`, logs in `outputs/logs/` and MongoDB.

The framework is modular, scalable, and uses placeholders for controller actions, ready for real-world extensions.
