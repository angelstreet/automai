- [x] **1.5** Implement Environment Profiles system ‚úÖ COMPLETED (included in DeviceManagement page)
- [x] **1.6** Add mock controllers (Remote, AV, Verification) ‚úÖ COMPLETED

**Database Tables Added** ‚úÖ
- `devices` - Device under test management with team-based RLS
- `controllers` - Controller configuration with team-based RLS  
- `environment_profiles` - Environment setup linking with team-based RLS

**API Endpoints Added** ‚úÖ
- `/api/devices` - CRUD operations for devices
- `/api/controllers` - CRUD operations for controllers
- `/api/environment-profiles` - CRUD operations for environment profiles
- Updated `/api/stats` to include device management statistics

**UI Components Added** ‚úÖ
- `DeviceManagement.tsx` - Complete device management interface with three tabs:
  - Device Registry: Add/edit/delete devices with type, model, version, environment
  - Controller Configuration: Configure Remote, AV, and Verification controllers
  - Environment Profiles: Link devices with controllers for complete test setups
- Added to main navigation in `App.tsx`

**Mock Controllers Added** ‚úÖ
- `RemoteController` - Simulates remote control actions (navigation, typing, volume)
- `AVController` - Simulates audio/video capture and analysis
- `VerificationController` - Simulates verification and validation functionality
- `demo_controllers.py` - Comprehensive demo script showing all controllers in action

**Mock Controller Types**:
- Remote Controller: print("Remote: LEFT", "Remote: RIGHT", "Remote: OK")
- AV Controller: print("AV: Capturing video", "AV: Audio detected")
- Verification Controller: print("Verify: Image appeared", "Verify: Text found")

- ‚úÖ Add expected_results JSONB field for expected outcomes
- ‚úÖ Add execution_config JSONB field for test execution parameters
- ‚úÖ Add tags array field for categorization
- ‚úÖ Add priority integer field (1-5 scale)
- ‚úÖ Add estimated_duration field for time estimation

### Task 2.2: Update test case editor for device integration ‚úÖ COMPLETED
- ‚úÖ Add device selection dropdown in test case editor
- ‚úÖ Add environment profile selection

### Task 2.3: Integrate controller usage in test execution ‚è≥ IN PROGRESS
- ‚úÖ Update backend API to support new test case fields
- ‚úÖ Update supabase_utils.py functions for enhanced test case management
- ‚è≥ Create test execution engine that uses selected controllers
- ‚è≥ Implement controller initialization based on environment profile
- ‚è≥ Add controller action execution in test steps

### Task 2.4: Add verification condition management ‚úÖ COMPLETED
- ‚úÖ Create verification condition interface with multiple types
- ‚úÖ Support for image, text, audio, video, and performance verifications
- ‚úÖ Critical vs non-critical condition flags
- ‚úÖ Timeout configuration per condition
- ‚úÖ Integration with verification controller

### Task 2.5: Update test execution engine ‚è≥ PENDING

## Current Sprint: Phase 1 - Device & Environment Management

### Sprint Goals:
1. Clean database schema (remove obsolete, add device management)
2. Create device registry with common device types
3. Implement mock controllers that print actions
4. Build environment profiles system

### Device Types to Support:
- **android_phone**: Android mobile devices
- **firetv**: Amazon Fire TV
- **appletv**: Apple TV
- **stb_eos**: Set-top box EOS
- **linux**: Linux systems
- **windows**: Windows systems
- **stb**: Generic set-top box

### Environment Types:
- **prod**: Production environment
- **preprod**: Pre-production environment  
- **dev**: Development environment
- **staging**: Staging environment

### Mock Controller Behavior:
```python
# Remote Controller
print("Remote[AndroidPhone]: LEFT")
print("Remote[FireTV]: OK") 
print("Remote[AppleTV]: MENU")

# AV Controller  
print("AV[HDMI]: Capturing video frame")
print("AV[Network]: Audio level detected: 75%")

# Verification Controller
print("Verify[Image]: 'play_button.png' appeared in 2.3s")
print("Verify[Text]: 'Video Player' found on screen")
print("Verify[Audio]: Background music detected")
```

## Next Steps:
1. Start with Task 1.1: Clean database schema
2. Implement device management tables
3. Create device registry API endpoints
4. Build device management UI

## Progress Tracking:
