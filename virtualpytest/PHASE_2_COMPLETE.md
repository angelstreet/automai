   - ❌ Removed all history state tracking
   - ❌ Removed undo/redo buttons from UI

2. **Clean Code Achieved**:

## 📋 **Next Steps:**

**Phase 3: Remove Progressive Loading** is ready to begin:
- Remove `loadedDepth`, `maxDepth`, `isProgressiveLoading`
- Remove `loadChildrenAtDepth`, `handleMenuEntry` functions
- Simplify tree loading to load all nodes at once

## 🔧 **User Experience Change:**

- **Before**: Users could undo/redo changes with buttons
- **After**: Users reload the page to cancel changes (as requested)
- **Benefit**: Simpler codebase, no complex history state management

## ⚠️ **Note:**

Some linter errors remain in NavigationEditor.tsx that are unrelated to history removal (type mismatches, property access issues). These should be addressed separately from the simplification phases.
