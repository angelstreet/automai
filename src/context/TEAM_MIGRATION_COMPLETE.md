# Team Context Migration Complete

This file indicates that the migration of team functionality from `TeamContext` to `UserContext` is complete.

## Migration Summary

- Team data is now embedded directly in the User model
- All team operations are now part of UserContext
- TeamContext and related files have been deprecated
- All components should now use the `useUser()` hook to access team data

## Implementation Details

1. **User model updated:**
   ```typescript
   export interface User {
     // Existing fields
     id: string;
     email: string;
     role: Role;
     tenant_id: string;
     // Added team fields
     teams?: UserTeam[];
     selectedTeamId?: string;
     teamMembers?: TeamMember[];
   }
   ```

2. **UserContext updated:**
   ```typescript
   export interface UserContextType {
     // Existing fields
     user: User | null;
     // Team-related fields
     teams: UserTeam[];
     selectedTeam: UserTeam | null;
     teamMembers: TeamMember[];
     setSelectedTeam: (teamId: string) => Promise<void>;
     checkResourceLimit: (resourceType: string) => Promise<ResourceLimit | null>;
   }
   ```

3. **Migration paths for components:**
   - Replace `import { useTeam } from '@/context'` with `import { useUser } from '@/context'`
   - Replace `const { teams, selectedTeam } = useTeam()` with `const { teams, selectedTeam } = useUser()`
   - Replace `selectTeam(teamId)` with `setSelectedTeam(teamId)`

## Benefits

1. Simplified API - single context to handle user and team data
2. Reduced API calls - user and team data fetched together
3. Better data consistency - all user-related data in one place
4. Simplified application architecture
