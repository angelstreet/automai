## Key Improvements

1. **Server-Client Architecture**

   - Clear separation between server and client components
   - Server components handle data fetching
   - Client components handle interactivity and state management
   - Components with 'use client' directive properly placed in client directory

2. **React Query Integration**

   - Replaced custom events with React Query for data fetching and state management
   - Improved data fetching with proper caching and invalidation
   - Better error handling and loading states

3. **View Mode Management**

   - Created dedicated hook for managing view mode preference
   - Persisted preference in localStorage
   - Simplified toggle between grid and table views

4. **Component Naming**

   - Standardized component naming to follow project conventions
   - Client components properly named with 'Client' suffix (e.g., HostActionsClient)
   - Server components properly named with 'Server' suffix where appropriate (e.g., StatusSummaryServer)

5. **Codebase Cleanup**
   - All obsolete files have been removed
   - No deprecated code remains in the codebase
   - Clean separation of concerns between client and server components
   - Removed legacy components dependent on deleted files

## Remaining Tasks

1. **Testing**

   - Verify all functionality works as expected:
     - Host creation
     - Host deletion
     - Connection testing
     - View mode toggle
     - Error handling

2. **Documentation Updates**
   - Update component documentation to reflect new architecture
   - Add JSDoc comments to key functions and components

## How to Test

1. **Basic Functionality**

   - Navigate to hosts page
   - Verify hosts load correctly
   - Test toggling between grid and table views
   - Test refresh functionality

2. **Host Management**

   - Test adding a new host
   - Test deleting a host
   - Test connection testing

3. **Edge Cases**
   - Test error handling with invalid inputs
   - Test with empty host list
   - Test with large number of hosts

## Migration Benefits

1. **Performance**

   - Server-side rendering for initial page load
   - Optimized client-side updates with React Query
   - Reduced waterfalls and duplicate fetching

2. **Code Quality**
   - Elimination of custom events improves maintainability
   - Consistent component structure
   - Standardized naming conventions
   - Better separation of concerns
   - Proper adherence to architecture guidelines
