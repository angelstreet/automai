### **üìå Automai SaaS PRD Breakdown**
Now that we have refined every detail, let‚Äôs structure the **Product Requirements Document (PRD)** into three main sections:  

1Ô∏è‚É£ **Overview**  
2Ô∏è‚É£ **Frontend** *(Sidebar, Main Content Specificity, Role-Based Access)*  
3Ô∏è‚É£ **Backend** *(Multi-Tenancy, Workflow, Approval Flow, Integrations, Security)*  

---

## **üìå 1. Overview**
### **üîπ What is Automai?**  
Automai is a **multi-tenant SaaS platform** designed for **test automation** on **web, desktop, and mobile environments**. It enables users to **write, deploy, execute, and analyze automated test cases** across different devices, OS, and browsers.

### **üîπ Key Features**  
‚úÖ **Test Script Development** (Script Editor with Git-based collaboration)  
‚úÖ **Test Execution & Deployment** (Manual, Scheduled, CI/CD integration)  
‚úÖ **Device & Environment Control** (Manage local and remote execution)  
‚úÖ **Test Reports & Analytics** (Dashboard, logs, error analysis)  
‚úÖ **Multi-Tenancy** (Each customer has its own workspace & teams)  
‚úÖ **Role-Based Access** (Admin, Developer, Tester, Viewer)  
‚úÖ **Approval Workflow** (Scripts move from Dev Mode to Prod Mode)  
‚úÖ **Integrations** (Slack, GitHub, GitLab, Jenkins, Grafana, Kibana)  
‚úÖ **Security & Resource Locking** (Lock scripts & devices during execution)  

---

## **üìå 2. Frontend**
The **frontend** is a **dynamic UI** with a **collapsible sidebar** and a **role-based main content area**.  

### **üîπ Sidebar Structure**
The sidebar dynamically adjusts based on **role-based permissions** and **multi-tenancy workspace**.

#### **üìå Sidebar Layout**
| **Icon** | **Section** | **Access Roles** |
|---------|------------|----------------|
| üè† | **Dashboard** | **All roles (View varies by role)** |
| ‚úçÔ∏è | **Test Development** | **Admin, Developer, Tester** |
| üöÄ | **Deployment & Execution** | **Admin, Developer, Tester** |
| üñ•Ô∏è | **Device & Environment Control** | **Admin, Developer, Tester** |
| üìä | **Reports & Analytics** | **Admin, Tester, Viewer** |
| ü§ù | **Team & Collaboration** | **Admin, Tester, Developer** |
| ‚öôÔ∏è | **Settings & Integrations** | **Admin, Developer** |
| üåü | **Upgrade to Pro (If Trial Mode)** | **Trial Users Only** |

---

### **üîπ Main Content Areas & Specificity**
Each section of the main content dynamically changes based on the user **role** and **context (test case, deployment, device control, etc.)**.

#### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Dashboard (All Roles, Different Views)**
- **Admin View:** Full metrics, execution logs, team management  
- **Developer View:** Active test scripts, recent commits, error debugging  
- **Tester View:** Assigned test runs, execution logs, reports  
- **Viewer View:** Reports and analytics only  

#### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Test Development (Admin, Developer, Tester)**
- **Project > Test Case > Test Suite > Test Plan Structure**  
- **Editor with Git-based Version Control**  
- **Locking Mechanism** (Prevents conflicts)  
- **Approval Workflow for pushing to Prod Mode**  
- **Live Commenting & Review System**  

#### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Deployment & Execution (Admin, Developer, Tester)**
- **Manual Execution (Run Now)**  
- **Scheduled Execution (Event-based, CI/CD)**  
- **Execution Logs & History**  
- **Environment & Device Selection**  

#### **4Ô∏è‚É£ Device & Environment Control (Admin, Developer, Tester)**
- **List of Available Environments**  
  - **Local Browsers (Chrome, Safari, Edge, Firefox)**  
  - **Physical Devices (Linux, Windows, macOS, Android, iOS)**  
  - **Docker Containers, Emulators**  
- **Remote Control & Debugging**  
- **Device Locking During Execution**  

#### **5Ô∏è‚É£ Reports & Analytics (Admin, Tester, Viewer)**
- **Graphical Reports (Pass/Fail Trends, Error Breakdown)**  
- **External Integrations (Grafana, Kibana)**  
- **AI-powered Insights (Future Enhancement)**  

#### **6Ô∏è‚É£ Team & Collaboration (Admin, Tester, Developer)**
- **Multi-Tenant Workspaces** (Each customer has their own isolated space)  
- **Role Management & Assignments**  
- **Task Assignments (Request Fix, Deployment, Result Analysis)**  
- **Internal Chat / Slack / Teams Notifications**  

#### **7Ô∏è‚É£ Settings & Integrations (Admin, Developer)**
- **Project Configurations**  
- **Git Integration (GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket)**  
- **CI/CD Pipelines (Jenkins, GitHub Actions)**  
- **API & Webhooks**  
- **Billing & Subscription**  

---

## **üìå 3. Backend**
The backend needs to support **multi-tenancy, approval workflows, integrations, and execution management**.

### **üîπ Multi-Tenancy Backend**
- **Isolated Workspaces:** Every tenant has a separate **database schema** or **data partition**.  
- **Trial Mode:** Users sign up with personal/professional email ‚Üí Get a temporary workspace.  
- **Pro Mode:** A SaaS Admin creates a **dedicated tenant** after subscription.  
- **Team-Based Access:** Each tenant has **sub-teams** with assigned roles.  

### **üîπ Approval Flow (Admin/Developer)**
- **Script states:** `Dev Mode` and `Prod Mode`  
- **Approval Process:** Developer submits ‚Üí Admin/Reviewer accepts, rejects, or requests modification.  
- **Commit History Integration:** Each approval action is logged in the **commit history** (like a Git merge request).  
- **Notifications & Logs:** Reviewers get **Slack/Email/In-App notifications**, and decisions are stored in history.  

### **üîπ Execution & Deployment Backend**
- **Execution Queue Management:** Schedules **test cases, test suites, and test plans** based on priority.  
- **Device Locking:** Prevents two tests from using the same device.  
- **CI/CD Pipeline Support:** Webhooks for Jenkins, GitHub Actions, etc.  

### **üîπ Security & Resource Locking**
- **Role-Based API Access** (Ensures least-privilege access per role).  
- **Locking System:**  
  - **Script Locking** (Prevents parallel edits).  
  - **Device Locking** (Prevents concurrent test execution).  

### **üîπ Integrations**
- **Git (GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket)** for **Version Control**  
- **CI/CD (Jenkins, GitHub Actions)** for **Automated Testing Pipelines**  
- **Grafana/Kibana** for **Advanced Reporting & Dashboards**  
- **Slack/MS Teams/Email** for **Notifications & Approval Workflows**

### **üöÄ Next Steps**
‚úÖ **Does this structure fully meet your vision before moving to UI prototyping?**  
‚úÖ **Would you like API endpoints for Backend workflows defined in detail?**  
‚úÖ **Do you have preferences for backend stack (Node.js, Python, Go, etc.)?**  
‚úÖ **Anything missing before we begin interactive mockups?**  

Let‚Äôs make sure this is **fully locked in before UI development!** üöÄ
