## Initial Setup - READ FIRST

**IMPORTANT: If this is a new chat, read all cursor rules first to understand the project structure and coding standards.**

1. Read these cursor rules in order:
   - general.mdc (this file) - Project overview and general guidelines
   - yolo-mode.mdc - Quick reference guide for YOLO mode development
   - config.mdc - Environment configuration
   - prisma.mdc - Database and Prisma setup
   - nextjs.mdc - Next.js structure and best practices
   - frontend.mdc - Frontend development guidelines
   - backend.mdc - Backend development guidelines
   - ui.mdc - UI component guidelines
   - websocket.mdc - WebSocket server and terminal implementation
   - code-organization.mdc - Code organization and file size guidelines
   - refactoring.mdc - Guidelines for refactoring and breaking up large files

2. Development workflow guidelines:
   - Always ask for permission before creating any new folder or file
   - Before suggesting removal of any file or folder, examine all related files to ensure nothing important is deleted
   - When troubleshooting issues, identify all possible causes, rank them by probability, and focus on the most likely one
   - For any code changes, first provide a detailed plan specifying:
     - Which files need to be modified
     - What specific changes are needed in each file
     - Why these changes will address the issue
   - Wait for explicit user approval before implementing any code changes
   - After major tasks (e.g., refactoring, feature implementation, dependency changes):
     1. Run `npm run build` to verify no build errors
     2. If build succeeds, suggest committing changes with a descriptive message
     3. If build fails, fix errors before proceeding
