# Team Feature Implementation Summary

## Overview

This document provides a summary of the team feature implementation for the Automai application. The implementation adds team-based organization and resource limitation capabilities to support three distinct subscription tiers:

1. **Trial Tier**: Single user, no teams, limited resources
2. **Pro Tier**: Single team with multiple users, moderate resource limits
3. **Enterprise Tier**: Multiple teams, users can belong to multiple teams, customizable resource limits

## Implementation Components

The implementation consists of the following key components:

### 1. Database Schema

- New tables for teams, team members, subscription tiers, and resource limits
- Column additions to existing resource tables for team association
- RLS policies to enforce team-based access control

### 2. Backend Layer

- Database functions for team and team member management
- Resource limit checking functionality
- Integration with existing resources (hosts, repositories, deployments, CICD providers)

### 3. Server Actions

- Team management actions (CRUD operations)
- Resource limit validation for all resource creation actions

### 4. Context System

- TeamContext provider for state management
- Integration with existing contexts (UserContext)
- Resource limit checking hooks

### 5. UI Components

- Team management page with team list and member management
- Team selector for enterprise users
- Resource limits visualization
- Integration with existing feature pages
