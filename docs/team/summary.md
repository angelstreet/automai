# Team Feature Implementation Summary

## Overview

The team feature adds team-based organization and resource limitation capabilities to the AutomAI application, supporting three distinct subscription tiers:

1. **Trial Tier**: Single user, no teams, limited resources
2. **Pro Tier**: Single team with multiple users, moderate resource limits
3. **Enterprise Tier**: Multiple teams, users can belong to multiple teams, customizable resource limits

## Architecture

The implementation follows a clean, three-layer architecture pattern:

1. **Database Layer**: Core database operations
   - Feature-specific modules in `/src/lib/supabase/db-teams/`
   - Team-integration modules for each resource type
   - Returns consistent `DbResponse<T>` objects

2. **Server Actions Layer**: Business logic
   - Feature-specific actions in `/src/app/actions/`
   - Handles business logic, validation, and authentication
   - Returns consistent `ActionResult<T>` objects
   - Enforces resource limits

3. **Client Hooks Layer**: UI integration
   - Context provider in `/src/context/teamContext.tsx`
   - Client hooks for team-integrated operations
   - Resource limit checking with user notifications

## Key Components

1. **Team Management**
   - CRUD operations for teams
   - Team member management with role-based access
   - Default team handling
   
2. **Resource Limitations**
   - Per-subscription tier resource limits
   - Resource limit checking before creation
   - Clear user feedback on limit violations
   
3. **Resource Team Association**
   - Team ownership of resources (hosts, repositories, deployments, CICD providers)
   - Resource filtering by team
   - Moving resources between teams (Enterprise tier)

4. **User Interface**
   - Team management page
   - Team selector for Enterprise users
   - Resource limit visualization

## Integration Approach

The team feature was integrated with existing features (hosts, repositories, deployments, CICD providers) using a non-invasive approach:

1. **Independent Integration Modules**
   - Separate database modules for team integration
   - Dedicated server actions for team-based operations
   - Specialized client hooks for team-aware components

2. **No UI Modifications**
   - Existing UI components remain unchanged
   - Team-aware functionality accessed through hooks
   - Progressive integration without breaking changes

3. **Consistent Resource Limit Checking**
   - Centralized resource limit checking
   - Unified user notification system
   - Subscription tier awareness

## Implementation Status

The team feature implementation is complete with all core components in place:

- ✅ Database schema changes
- ✅ Core team management functionality
- ✅ Resource limit checking
- ✅ Integration with all resource types
- ✅ Team management UI
- ✅ Enterprise team selector

Next steps include adding unit tests, detailed documentation, data migration scripts, and team-aware UI components.
