# Frontend Guidelines

## 1. Overview
### 1.1 Purpose
This document defines the **frontend requirements** for the Automai SaaS platform, structured for a **Next.js (React) TypeScript implementation**. It includes a **detailed sidebar structure**, role-based UI behavior, global layout, and an outline of all necessary pages and components. Each section will have its own dedicated page description to ensure developers can build the app page by page and component by component.

### 1.2 Scope
- **Platform:** Web-based SaaS UI (Next.js + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS)
- **Multi-Language Support:** i18n (Internationalization) with JSON-based translations
- **Multi-Tenancy Support:** Role-based access and isolated workspaces
- **Routing Strategy:** Next.js App Router with Layout Components
- **Authentication:** JWT-based Auth (NextAuth.js or Custom)
- **State Management:** React Context or Zustand
- **Dynamic UI Based on Role Permissions**
- **Collapsible Sidebar & Adaptive Layout**
- **Role Switcher for Development:** Temporary role switcher for testing UI across different roles

## 2. Global Layout Definition
### 2.1 Layout Structure
The global layout consists of:
1. **Header (Top Navigation, Global Search, Quick Actions, User Profile)**
2. **Collapsible Sidebar (Primary Navigation with Automai Branding)**
3. **Main Content Area (Dynamically Updates Based on Page)**
4. **Footer (Status Information, Legal Notices, Versioning)**
5. **Temporary Role Switcher (For Development & Testing Only)**

### 2.2 Page Routing Strategy (Next.js App Router)
- **Public Pages**
  - `/` → Landing Page (Marketing, Signup, Pricing, with Header & Footer)
  - `/login` → Login Page (Auth & Password Recovery, with Header & Footer)
  - `/signup` → Registration Page
  - `/pricing` → Plan Details & Subscription Options
- **Protected Pages (Requires Auth & Role-Based Access, No Header/Footer)**
  - `/dashboard` → Main Dashboard
  - `/projects` → List of Test Projects
  - `/projects/[id]` → Project Details (Tests, Reports, Settings)
  - `/scripts` → Test Script Editor & Management
  - `/deployments` → Scheduled Test Executions
  - `/devices` → Device & Environment Control
  - `/reports` → Test Reports & Analytics
  - `/team` → User Management & Collaboration
  - `/settings` → Account Settings & Integrations
- **Admin-Only Pages**
  - `/admin` → Global Tenant Management
  - `/admin/billing` → Subscription & Payment Management
