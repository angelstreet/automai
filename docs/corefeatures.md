# Core Features of the SaaS Automation Platform

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Development: Building Automation Scripts**

### **Overview**

The primary goal of the SaaS is to enable users to develop automation scripts for Web, Mobile, and Desktop applications efficiently, while also integrating Vision AI capabilities.

### **Key Features**

- **AI-Powered Automation**: AI assists in script generation, optimization, and error prediction.
- **Multi-Platform Support**: Web (Playwright), Mobile (Appium), Desktop (Pywinauto), Vision AI (Omniparser).
- **Script Editor**: Web-based code editor with syntax highlighting and live preview.
- **Use Case Management**: Users create structured automation test cases under projects.
- **Version Control**: Each script is automatically versioned using a Git-based system.
- **Platform-Aware Execution**: Test cases are tagged based on platform type (Web üåê, Mobile üì±, Desktop üíª, Vision AI üëÅÔ∏è).
- **Exportable Test Scripts**: Users can download their scripts in IDE-compatible formats (Python, JS).
- **Team Collaboration**: Developers can comment, assign tasks, and share scripts within teams.
- **Resource Locking**: Prevents conflicts by ensuring only one user can edit a script at a time.

### **Development Workflow**

1. **User Creates a Project** ‚Üí Adds test cases & defines automation steps.
2. **Selects Platform Type** ‚Üí Web, Mobile, Desktop, or Vision AI.
3. **Script is Auto-Generated with AI Assistance** ‚Üí Based on selected actions (Navigate, Click, Type, Verify, AI Recognition, etc.).
4. **Live Testing in Browser (For Web)** ‚Üí Instant validation of test steps.
5. **Script is Versioned in Git** ‚Üí Changes are auto-tracked, and rollback is possible.
6. **Export Option** ‚Üí Users can download fully runnable scripts for external use.

## **2Ô∏è‚É£ Execution: Running Automation Scripts**

### **Overview**

Once a script is developed, users should be able to execute it either locally (on their machine) or in the cloud.

### **Key Features**

- **Execution Modes**:
  - **Local Execution** ‚Üí Runs on the user's local machine using Playwright, Appium, or Pywinauto.
  - **Cloud Execution** ‚Üí Deploys tests to cloud VMs for distributed execution.
- **SSH Terminal Access**:
  - **Direct SSH Connection** ‚Üí Connect to remote machines via secure SSH terminal.
  - **Command Execution** ‚Üí Run commands directly on target machines.
  - **Terminal Resizing** ‚Üí Dynamically resize terminal to fit the viewport.
  - **Session Logging** ‚Üí Track all terminal sessions and commands.
- **Test Deployment Table** ‚Üí Tracks all executions, status (Running, Success, Failed), and timestamps.
- **Parallel Execution** ‚Üí Supports multi-instance execution for scaling tests.
- **Headless & Interactive Modes** ‚Üí Users can choose between headless testing or live UI interaction.
- **Scheduled Execution** ‚Üí Run tests on a recurring schedule (Daily, Weekly, CI/CD Integration).
- **Environment Management** ‚Üí Execute tests across different OS, browsers, and devices.
- **Live Execution Logs** ‚Üí View real-time logs & errors while tests are running.
- **Kibana & Supabase Integration** ‚Üí Logs, execution metadata, and reports stored for analysis.
- **Cross-Platform Test Mixing**: Users can execute **Web, Mobile, and Desktop scripts in a single campaign**, ensuring full automation flexibility.

### **Execution Workflow**

1. **User Selects a Test Case** ‚Üí Chooses a script from the project.
2. **Chooses Execution Mode** ‚Üí Local or Cloud.
3. **Execution Starts** ‚Üí Playwright (Web), Appium (Mobile), Pywinauto (Desktop) automates the test.
4. **Logs & Screenshots Captured** ‚Üí Stored in Supabase & Elasticsearch for Kibana visualization.
5. **Execution Results Stored** ‚Üí Test execution metadata is recorded in the database.
6. **Execution Table Updated** ‚Üí Users track test runs & status from the UI.

## **3Ô∏è‚É£ Analysis: Reviewing & Optimizing Test Results**

### **Overview**

Analyzing execution results is essential to track test performance, detect failures, and improve scripts.

### **Key Features**

- **Execution Reports**:
  - HTML reports (`report.html`) for each test run.
  - Includes test steps, logs, execution time, screenshots, and video.
- **Kibana Dashboards**:
  - Real-time log monitoring & filtering.
  - Test trend analytics (pass/fail rates, error distribution).
- **Failure Insights**:
  - AI-based error classification.
  - Screenshot/video comparison for failed steps.
- **Exportable Reports**:
  - CSV/PDF export of execution summary.
- **CI/CD Reporting**:
  - Test results integrated with Jenkins, GitHub Actions, and Slack notifications.
- **Execution Comparison**:
  - Compare two test runs to detect performance issues or regressions.

### **Analysis Workflow**

1. **User Navigates to Reports Section** ‚Üí Lists all executed tests.
2. **Filters by Project, Use Case, Execution Date, Status** ‚Üí Finds relevant test runs.
3. **Opens `report.html` for a Detailed View** ‚Üí Contains step-by-step execution logs.
4. **Reviews Screenshots & Videos** ‚Üí Debugs failures visually.
5. **Uses Kibana for Advanced Log Analysis** ‚Üí Real-time error tracking.
6. **Exports Reports** ‚Üí Generates PDF/CSV for team reporting.
