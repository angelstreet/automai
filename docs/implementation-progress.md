    - Added repository selectors for optimized component rendering
    
  - ‚úÖ Updated DeploymentContext to retrieve user data from UserContext:
    - Added singleton pattern with DEPLOYMENT_CONTEXT_INITIALIZED flag
    - Added proper memoization with useMemo for context value
    - Implemented getUserData() to retrieve data from UserContext
    - Eliminated redundant user data fetching
    - Added integration with UserContext.refreshUser()
    - Added centralized useDeployment hook export
    - Added deployment selectors for optimized component rendering
    - Enhanced error handling with fallback values

### Next Steps
- Update remaining components to use the centralized context imports
- Complete cross-context communication implementation:
  - Add useUser in DeploymentContext to track user-initiated deployments
  - Add useUser in CICDContext to provide context for CI/CD operations
- Update AppContext to re-export all context hooks properly
- Optimize props passing for frequently re-rendered components
- Apply request protection to all critical data fetching operations
- Add more context selectors to prevent unnecessary rerenders
- Add integration tests for cross-context communication

## Phase 3: Server Actions Optimization (UPCOMING)

In the next phase, we will optimize server actions to:

1. Accept user parameter to avoid redundant authentication
2. Implement server-side caching utility in `src/lib/cache.ts`
3. Apply caching to authentication-heavy operations
4. Update API routes to use centralized caching

This will complete the optimization of data flow across the three layers:
- DB Layer: Supabase database operations
- Server Actions Layer: Server-side business logic with caching
- Client Hooks Layer: Client-side state management with request protection

## Implementation Notes

The implemented changes follow these key patterns:

1. **Singleton Pattern**: Each context now has a module-level flag to ensure only one instance is created, with warnings when duplicates are detected.

2. **Centralized Imports**: All contexts are now exported from a single entry point (`/src/context/index.ts`), making it easier to manage and use contexts consistently.

3. **Request Protection**: A robust request protection system prevents duplicate API calls using both local (component-level) and global request caching.

4. **Cross-Context Communication**: The foundation for contexts to share data (especially user data) has been established, reducing redundant API calls.

5. **Performance Optimization**: Added memoization of context values and safe state updates to prevent unnecessary re-renders.

These changes provide immediate benefits:
- Reduced duplicate API calls for user data
- Prevention of multiple context instances
- More efficient state updates
- Improved caching for better performance
- Better developer experience with clear import patterns

## Metrics Impact (Estimated)
- API calls for user data: ‚¨áÔ∏è ~75% reduction
- Component render frequency: ‚¨áÔ∏è ~30% reduction 
- Time to interactive: ‚¨áÔ∏è ~15% improvement
- Code maintainability: ‚¨ÜÔ∏è Significantly improved

## Upcoming Work
The next phase will focus on updating components to use the centralized context system and implementing cross-context communication for all contexts. This will further reduce API calls and improve application performance.
