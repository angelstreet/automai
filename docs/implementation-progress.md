# SWR Migration Implementation Progress

This document tracks the implementation progress of migrating from our custom context cache to SWR.

## Overview
- Start Date: March 26, 2025
- Status: Complete
- Completed Phases: 7/7 (Infrastructure Setup, Repository Context, Host Context, Deployment Context, CICD Context, Testing and Optimization, Code Cleanup)

## Summary
All implementation phases are complete. We have successfully migrated all context providers to use SWR:

1. Repository Context - Complete ✅
2. Host Context - Complete ✅  
3. Deployment Context - Complete ✅
4. CICD Context - Complete ✅
5. Integration Testing - Complete ✅
6. Code Cleanup - Complete ✅

The migration from our custom caching solution to SWR has been successfully completed.

## Progress Checklist

### Phase 1: Infrastructure Setup

### Phase 6: Testing and Optimization
- [x] Create integrated context exports
- [x] Create integration test components
- [x] Create cleanup plan
- [x] Performance verification
- [x] Fix any issues

### Phase 7: Code Cleanup
- [x] Remove `persistedData` from AppContext
- [x] Update context implementations
- [x] Replace server-side cache implementation with stubs
- [x] Clean up any remaining code

## Detailed Progress Notes

### Phase 1: Infrastructure Setup
✅ Completed
- ✅ SWR is already installed as a dependency (version 2.3.3)
- ✅ Updated SWRProvider with optimized configuration in src/components/providers/SWRProvider.tsx
- ✅ Created fetcher utility in src/lib/fetcher.ts with support for server actions and API routes
- ✅ SWRProvider is already included in the app layout (src/app/layout.tsx) and properly exported from providers index

### Phase 2: Repository Context Migration
✅ Completed
- ✅ Created repository SWR hooks in src/hooks/useRepositoryData.ts with dedicated hooks for fetching repositories and managing star status
- ✅ Created new Repository context in src/context/NewRepositoryContext.tsx using SWR for data fetching with proper memoization and performance optimization
- ✅ Created test component in src/components/test/TestRepositoryContext.tsx to verify the new context functionality

### Phase 3: Host Context Migration
✅ Completed
- ✅ Created host SWR hooks in src/hooks/useHostData.ts with dedicated hooks for fetching hosts, retrieving host details, and checking connection status
- ✅ Created new Host context in src/context/NewHostContext.tsx using SWR for data fetching with comprehensive host management functionality
- ✅ Created test component in src/components/test/TestHostContext.tsx to verify the new context functionality

### Phase 4: Deployment Context Migration
✅ Completed
- ✅ Created deployment SWR hooks in src/hooks/useDeploymentData.ts with dedicated hooks for fetching deployments, repository scripts, hosts, and managing deployment operations
- ✅ Created new Deployment context in src/context/NewDeploymentContext.tsx using SWR for data fetching with a clean API that matches the original context interface
- ✅ Created test component in src/components/test/TestDeploymentContext.tsx to verify the new context functionality

### Phase 5: CICD Context Migration
✅ Completed
- ✅ Created CICD SWR hooks in src/hooks/useCICDData.ts with dedicated hooks for fetching providers, jobs, and managing CICD operations
- ✅ Created new CICD context in src/context/NewCICDContext.tsx using SWR for data fetching with a clean API that matches the original context interface
- ✅ Created test component in src/components/test/TestCICDContext.tsx to verify the new context functionality

### Phase 6: Testing and Optimization
✅ Completed
- ✅ Created new version of context index file (src/context/index.ts) that exports the SWR-based contexts
- ✅ Created integration test component (src/components/test/TestSWRIntegration.tsx) that uses all new contexts together
- ✅ Created cleanup list (docs/cleanup-list.md) with files and code that need to be removed in Phase 7
- ✅ Performance verification completed - SWR built-in caching shows improved performance over custom cache
- ✅ Integration tests passing with no issues

### Phase 7: Code Cleanup
✅ Completed
- ✅ Removed `persistedData` usage from AppContext (replaced with empty object + deprecation notice)
- ✅ Replaced cache.ts with stub implementation showing deprecation warnings
- ✅ Removed global window references in useUser hook
- ✅ Updated context index to use SWR-based context implementations
- ✅ Verified all functionality works correctly after cleanup
